<h1>Write down your feelings</h1>
<p>
  One powerful form of self-help is expressing your feelings through writing or
  anxiety journaling. Penning your emotions in a private place offers a safe
  space to acknowledge and explore your feelings. This process brings clarity
  and helps you identify the sources of your sadness if you’re unsure. Think of
  it as a self-guided exploration, offering insights into your emotional
  landscape.

<h1>Breathe</h1>
<p>
  Simple breathing exercises or meditation practices are excellent ways to calm
  yourself down, and they can work wonders for all types of stress and anxiety.
  When you focus on your breath, you ground yourself in the present moment,
  creating a sense of stability that can alleviate feelings of sadness.

<h1>Cry if you need to</h1>
<p>
  Studies show it’s actually good for you because it releases happy hormones. If
  you feel the urge to cry, allow yourself that release. It's a form of
  emotional expression that offers relief and healing.
