  <h1 class="heading">1. Write down your feelings</h1>
  <h2>
    One powerful form of self-help is expressing your feelings through writing
    or anxiety journaling. Penning your emotions in a private place offers a
    safe space to acknowledge and explore your feelings. This process brings
    clarity and helps you identify the sources of your sadness if you’re unsure.
    Think of it as a self-guided exploration, offering insights into your
    emotional landscape.

  <h1 class="heading">2. Breathe</h1>
  <h2>
    Simple breathing exercises or meditation practices are excellent ways to
    calm yourself down, and they can work wonders for all types of stress and
    anxiety. When you focus on your breath, you ground yourself in the present
    moment, creating a sense of stability that can alleviate feelings of
    sadness.
  </h2>
  <h1 class="heading">3. Cry if you need to</h1>
  <h2>
    Studies show it’s actually good for you because it releases happy hormones.
    If you feel the urge to cry, allow yourself that release. It's a form of
    emotional expression that offers relief and healing.
