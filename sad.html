<h1>Listen to music</h1>
<p>
  Music can help you concentrate and significantly influence your mood. A song
  with a positive message or an uplifting beat can remind you of the things you
  love, offering an easy and enjoyable way to combat feelings of sadness. Turn
  on one of your favorite songs and let the music flow.

<h1>Prioritize sleep</h1>
<p>
  Inadequate sleep causes irritability and stress, so prioritizing is essential
  to stabilizing your mood. Take a look at your sleep hygiene habits and try to
  find ways to get more rest.

<h1>Do something that makes you happy</h1>
<p>
  Pursue activities that bring you joy and lift your spirits, even if you donâ€™t
  feel like doing them in the moment. Whether dancing in your living room,
  playing with your pet, or simply enjoying a cup of your favorite tea, find
  happiness in small moments.
