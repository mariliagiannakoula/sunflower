    <h1>1. Do something creative</h1>
    <h2>
      Painting, writing, or gardening are great ways to express your emotions
      and lift your spirits. They can help you navigate and eventually work
      through your feelings, or simply offer a distraction if that’s what you
      need. Think outside the box and find something that ignites your passion.
    </h2>
    <h1>2. Listen to music</h1>
    <h2>
      Music can help you concentrate and significantly influence your mood. A
      song with a positive message or an uplifting beat can remind you of the
      things you love, offering an easy and enjoyable way to combat feelings of
      sadness. Turn on one of your favorite songs and let the music flow.
      <h1>3. Talk it out</h1>
    <h2>
    Sharing your feelings with a trusted individual can provide tremendous
    relief. They might not know what to say to someone who is sad, but that
    isn’t the point. This is about vocalizing your emotions and being
    vulnerable, allowing someone else to offer support, understanding, and a
    fresh perspective if they have it. </h2>
