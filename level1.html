    <h1>1. Write down your feelings</h1>
    <h2>
      One powerful form of self-help is expressing your feelings through writing
      or anxiety journaling. Penning your emotions in a private place offers a
      safe space to acknowledge and explore your feelings. This process brings
      clarity and helps you identify the sources of your sadness if you’re
      unsure. Think of it as a self-guided exploration, offering insights into
      your emotional landscape.
    </h2>
    <h1>2. Breathe</h1>
    <h2>
      Simple breathing exercises or meditation practices are excellent ways to
      calm yourself down, and they can work wonders for all types of stress and
      anxiety. When you focus on your breath, you ground yourself in the present
      moment, creating a sense of stability that can alleviate feelings of
      sadness.
      <h1>3. Cry if you need to</h1>
    <h2>
    Sometimes people cry at work, around friends or family, or alone. And
    studies show it’s actually good for you because it releases happy hormones.
    If you feel the urge to cry, allow yourself that release. It's a form of
    emotional expression that offers relief and healing.
    </h2>
    <h1>4. Prioritize sleep</h1>
    <h2>
      University of Pennsylvania researchers found that individuals limited to
      4.5 hours of sleep a night for one week reported more anger, sadness, and
      mental exhaustion. Inadequate sleep causes irritability and stress, so
      prioritizing is essential to stabilizing your mood. Take a look at your
      sleep hygiene habits and try to find ways to get more rest
